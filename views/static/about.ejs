    <h1>About Us</h1>
    
    <p>
      At <strong>WanderLust</strong>, we believe travel is more than a destination — it's an experience. Our mission is to connect explorers with curated stays that offer warmth, authenticity, and a story to tell.

      Founded by a team of travel enthusiasts and developers, WanderLust started with a simple idea: to create a platform that brings people closer to local culture, comfort, and community. Whether you're booking a beachside cottage, a cabin in the woods, or a city loft, we ensure that every listing is vetted and every host empowered.
